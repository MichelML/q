<h1>Q - Search top places in Quebec city</h1>   
  
Q, pronounced _cue_, helps you search nice places to visit in the very welcoming city of [Quebec](https://www.google.ca/maps/place/Ville+de+Qu%C3%A9bec,+QC/@46.8576655,-71.6262536,10z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x4cb8968a05db8893:0x8fc52d63f0e83a03!8m2!3d46.8138783!4d-71.2079809), located in the province of Quebec, Canada.

## Preview the application  
You have two options for testing and using Q. 
### Option 1 - Preview on the Web
You can view the application directly in your browser at the following [link](https://michelml.github.io/q/dist/public/).  
### Option 2 - Preview locally
Once [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), and [Git](https://git-scm.com/) are installed on your computer, go to the local directory of your choice from your terminal, and run the following command:  
```  
git clone https://github.com/MichelML/q.git
```
Now the project being on your computer, you can preview the application locally by following these steps:  
  
1. Go to the `dist` folder of the project directory  
2. Run the command `node index.js` in your terminal  
3. View the application in your favorite browser at the following address: `http://127.0.0.1/8080`  
  
## Edit the application  
After cloning the project on your computer, you can also edit the application to your taste by accessing the commented and structured version of the project in the `src` directory.  

### Build process  
This application also comes bundled with Gulp and basic build tasks helping you move from the development version of the project to distribution. After cloning the repository, run the following command from the project's root directory (`q/`) to install all dependencies of the build process:  
```  
npm install
```  
Once all the dependencies are installed, you can run the default Gulp process by typing the following command in your terminal: 
```
gulp
```
You can also run independent tasks by running the following command:  
```
gulp <name of the task>
```  
To learn more about what is Gulp and how to use it, [visit Gulp's website](http://gulpjs.com/).
